                Well, I just want to say thank you to this TA Shabir. He helped me with both the course materials and assignments and I really
                appreciate it. He is absolutely reachable from discussion board and also the Facebook, and he clarifies things
                in details such as class material, assignments etc. Each time I sent him an email and asked him for help
                , he was so patient and willing to help and indeed it made me easier to understand. Shabir is one of the
                best TAs that I ever had in McGill so far, love him so much. Thanks!

                Shabir was a fantastic TA; one of the best I have ever had. He was very active on the facebook page answering questions and
                the one time I interacted with him in person he was very helpful. I also really appreciated how when I submitted
                an assignment that did not run properly, he took the time to read my code rather than just giving me a 0.
                I hope I have him again sometime!

                Shabir was quick to answer everyone's questions that were posted in the COMP 206 Facebook group. He explained concepts clearly,
                and in great detail. I have never seen a TA been so active in a Facebook group for a class, and be so helpful.
                He helped so many students throughout the entire semester. He also marked one of my assignments, and gave
                me great feedback! One of the best TAs at Mccill!
